# 17s1-cs9417 Assignment 2
This github repo is created as a part of the [Assignment 2](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~mike/comp9417/ass2_proj.html/) of [COMP9417 Machine Learning and Data Mining](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9417) taught at [Unviersity of New South Wales](https://www.unsw.edu.au)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See Running for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Following prerequisites are essential for this code to run.

```
git
python3
pip3
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
tensorflow
```

Following commands are just a reference to install the dependencies on a Ubuntu like linux system. Please refer to their respective websites to properly install the dependencies

```
sudo apt-get install git

sudo apt-get install python3

sudo apt-get install python3-pip

pip3 install numpy

pip3 install pandas

pip3 install matplotlib

pip3 install tensorflow
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Once the dependencies are installed, clone this github repository onto your local machine as follows
```
git clone git@github.com:suryaavala/17s1-cs9417.git
```

Then cd into the cloned directory

```
cd 17s1-cs9417
```

## Testing the Installation

Run the following commands to test if the code has been installed properly

```
cd code

python3 mnist_nn.py
```

Expected output
```
You did not run the program as designed
Please run the program again as follows(case sensitive Train!=train):
python3 mnist_nn.py train/predict
Exiting the program...
```
If you see the above output, then the installation is successful

## Running

The code can be run to either Train the classifier or to Predict the results using the pretrained classifier

### Train
Inorder to train the classifier run the following code

```
pwd
```
Make sure your current directory is ```/17s1-cs9417/code/```

```
python3 mnist_nn.py train

```
The classifier takes around ~60min to run on a 1.7GHz Intel Dual Core i7 processor.
During the program execution you'll be seeing something like follows:
```

step 29800, training accuracy 1
step 29900, training accuracy 1
test accuracy 0.9927
Model saved in file: ./model/model.ckpt
```
### Predict

Inorder to predict the labels using create a csv like this [test.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data) and place it in
```
17s1-cs9417/code/data
```

And then run the following command
```
python3 mnist_nn.py predict
```
Predicted results will be saved in
```
17s1-cs9417/submission_softmax.csv
```
